We use a number of these LFO modulated pulse ugens with varying LFO type and rate (and phase in some cases) to provide the LFO with a different starting point. We then mix all these pulses together to create a thick sound and then feed it through a resonant low pass filter (rlpf). For extra bass, one of the pulses is an octave lower (half the frequency) and its LFO has a little bit of randomisation thrown into its frequency component for that extra bit of variety.",
