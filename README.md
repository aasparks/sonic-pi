# Sonic Pi

Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. I'm absolutely in love with
Sonic Pi's ease of use and great sound, and I'm duplicating parts of its
functionality... even down to the name.

This code is most easily installed using racket's package manager, `raco`:

raco pkg install sonic-pi

Let me make it absolutely clear, just in case: this package is NOT a
version of Sonic Pi; it's a bunch of code that uses scsynth in just the
same way that sonic pi does.

To see what it can currently do, try installing the package and then
running the file(s) in the `examples` subdirectory.
